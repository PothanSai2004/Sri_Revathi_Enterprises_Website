                        <p>A polybag is a bag made out of polyethylene, one of the most common formulations of plastic available 
                            today. The average thickness of a polybag for the most common polybag applications ranges from 1-6 mils of thickness. With that being said, there are specialty bags that 
                            come in thinner or thicker options.
